# Passage - Digital Library System

### Description :
As an avid reader, a gap I found in book reading platforms such as Goodreads and Storygraph is an appealing interface for books read. Existing platforms such as those
two focus on the community and statistics side at the expense of capturing the style of physical bookshelves. Passage is a digital library system designed to focus 
solely on the interface and providing an adequate user experience for managing books.

#### Main Library Interface

The main interface is a responsive grid view of book covers with extra details such as genre, pagecount or author being displayed on hover. These details are easy to add
as the system makes use of the OpenLibrary API, meaning users can use URLs in the right format to automatically fill in detail fields. This means data does not need to be 
entered manually which can be tedious.

#### To Read Interface (with Hover)
